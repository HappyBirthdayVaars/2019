Dear Vaars,
We've known each other for a fairly long time now, all the way from the awkward first meeting at Starbucks to planning to nap after exams but going to deetee instead. All I can say is, college has been a weird, wacky ride, but it wouldn't have been any fun without you. From the fights that end with hugs to the endless dinner dates, thank you for sticking around. Love you, and happy birthday, my forever roomie.
